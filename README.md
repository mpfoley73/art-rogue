🎨 Chatbot Concept: **“ArtRogue – The Unsnobby Museum Companion”**

🧠 Core Idea

A chatbot that guides users through museum collections with irreverent commentary, historical depth, and unexpected connections—like spotting birds in Renaissance paintings or comparing Baroque excess to modern fashion.

🔍 Features Waldemar Would Love

-   **Birdwatching in Art Mode**\
    “Show me paintings with goldfinches or magpies.”\
    → Pulls from museum APIs and highlights symbolic meanings.

-   **Art vs. Life Commentary**\
    “What does Caravaggio teach us about street violence?”\
    → Juxtaposes historical context with modern parallels, Januszczak-style.

-   **Style Battles**\
    “Who’s more outrageous—Rococo or Punk?”\
    → Uses visual features and metadata to compare eras with sass.

-   **Museum Explorer**\
    “Take me through the Met like Waldemar would.”\
    → Offers curated tours with cheeky insights and thematic twists.

-   **Art Mysteries Mode**\
    “Why is that figure in Van Eyck’s painting so weirdly proportioned?”\
    → Dives into unresolved debates and invites speculation.
