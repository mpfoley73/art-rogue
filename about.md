Art Rogue is a Shiny application designed to provide an interactive tour of the [Cleveland Museum of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/) and [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/). Enjoy interactive commentary while viewing famous artwork.

I have no affiliation with the museums. This is just an experimental project for me to learn more about creating Shiny apps and chat-bots. Also, the CMA here in Cleveland is awesome, and the project was a neat way to explore and learn more about it.
