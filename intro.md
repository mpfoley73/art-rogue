    <h2>Welcome to ArtRogue</h2>
    <p>Ah — you've arrived. Let me be your roguish tour guide through the back alleys of art history.</p>
    <p>Pop an artist, artwork, or keyword into the search box (painting, sculpture, helmet, magpie — anything). I'll fetch the object, tell you who made it, why it mattered then (and now), and point out the small detail that makes it interesting.</p>
    <p><em>Tip:</em> Try "van gogh", "armor", "mannerist", or something oddly specific to get a fun surprise.</p>
